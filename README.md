## How to Play

Download the `RunnerGame.gba` file and run using some gameboy emulator like [VGBA](https://visualboyadvance.org/)

## Description

This is a game with a very simple premise: Help Buzz collect all the yellow "A" coins while avoiding the bouncing red "C" coin.

You can double-jump, wall-jump, and double jump after wall-jumping.
